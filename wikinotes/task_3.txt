===== Notes =====

Making a website from scratch is something I don't have much experience with, however I do have some.
What experience I do have with making a website from scratch, is with Python Flask.
Preliminary research on the task suggest I need to apply for a Steam web API key, and to apply for one, I would need a domain name.
That's quite the barrier. Especially since I would want to test from my local PC, rather than setting up on some free hosting site somewhere with a free domain name.

I do not know how strict this domain name request is, or what it functions is in regerstering it with steam, but filling in "google.com" did yield a key.
I attempt either that or some free domain name if the alternative idea below don't work out.

That alternative idea? Well, the same page that mentions the API, also have a section on the "Steam OpenID Provider".
This provider will yield the user id, and I should be able to fish out the username and avatar from that alone, presuming that information is publically avavible without the above APIs.

Since I have decided to use python, I need a "OpenID library" for Python. Luckly, there is one. The repo comes however with a warning of lacking documentation and maintenace.
We'll see how this goes.
