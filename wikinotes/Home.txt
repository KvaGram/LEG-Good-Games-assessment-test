I will be keeping to the industry language of english for all of this.
This wiki is written in Zim, but can be easly read in pure-text.

This wiki exists for keeping notes and explaining my thought process of solving these 3 tasks.


First task I wish to attempt, is [[task 3]].

-
After some hours struggling task 3, I had to start over with a new approach.
See detailed notes in [[task 3]]
-
Task 3 is completed.
-
Next task I will attempt is [[task 2]] .
-
Task 2 failed. I may need assistance in fuguring out what went wrong.
that just leaves task 1 to attempt.
-
Task 1 seems overwhelming. Might get back to it later, if there is time.
