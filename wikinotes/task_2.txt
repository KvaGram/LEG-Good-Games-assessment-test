Sounds simple enough. So the question is how.
Time for research and planning.

I am given the search url, but that one is used for front-end user search.
Unless I'm expected to pick games manually, and copy-paste into a html-table, I think that may be a red herring.
Digging a bit deeper, I learned that there is a web search apis for things like getting list of games from steam, and it's in json format.
I just need to figure out the correct request.
If I can figure out how to make this search, and how to apply filters in the search query, then that alone is a good chunk of the task.
I will probobly not be able to do all the filters in the query, so I may need to filter the rest in the backend code.

The correct api to search with is "ISteamApps"
https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamApps
example web request
"GET https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v2/"

Trying the link gets me a list so huge, that firefox stuggles to load it with the built-in JSON reader
That gives me an idea. The manual seach includes the search parameters int he full rul (becouse, duh).
If the exact same filters can be applied in the api, that willl save me on doing my own filters.
-
test failed. Pasting the search query from the seach site into the api url did not filter the results. uh well. Worth a try.
Maybe I will figure it out later.

Time start coding. Since I have already started to learn php working on [[task 3]], I will attempt php for this task as well.
-
Problem. Reading the raw json I get from  GetAppList, I only get the names and appid.
This task may not be as simple as I imagined. Then again, the list I get weights 6 megabytes.
If that is just name and id, I honestly fear how much every detail I need would weigh.

However, I can use this first list to apply the first filter, if I can figure out how to read the data and apply filters.

-
I have struggled a bit with how php stores the result from a decode_JSON call, and how to read from it.
The documentation is a bit unclear. This suggests the structure is something so basic in php's system, that you are expected to implicetly know it.
It could be simular to a javascript object. Though some example codes show what looks like a hashmap or dictionary implementation.
I also learned that the echo statement don't implicetly convert non-strings to string. It seems var_dump is tool for that job.
-
succesfully applied a filter to reject entries including the character a.
